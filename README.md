## Overview

Open the file corresponding to a Liquid tag for [reusable text](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/data/reusables), a [variable](https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/data/variables), or [feature-based versioning](https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/data/features#feature-based-versioning), in the markdown file for an article on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com).

This Visual Studio Code extension works with markdown files in the public and internal repositories for GitHub's public-facing documentation. For example, the public [`docs`](https://github.com/github/docs) repository. 

While you're displaying a markdown file for a GitHub help article in Visual Studio Code, you can click the Liquid tag for a variable or a reusable, the opening tag for feature-based versioning, or the feature-based versioning string in the front matter, and then run the extension to open the related file for the variable, reusable, or version in a new Visual Studio Code tab. 

You can also quickly copy the tag for a variable or a reusable. This is useful when you need to use the same variable more than once in an article.

## Using the extension

* To open a reusable file, a variable file, or a feature-based versioning file:

   Either select some markdown containing a reusable, a variable, or a feature-based versioning tag, or just click inside the tag to place the cursor there, then press:

   **Mac**: <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd>
   
   **Windows**: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd>

* To copy a [Liquid tag](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/), such as the reference to a reusable or variable:

   Click inside the tag to place the cursor there, then press:

   **Mac**: <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>

   **Windows**: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
   
   You can also use the copy function to create the Liquid tag for a reusable, a variable, or a feature version, and put this into the clipboard for pasting into a Markdown file:
   - In a variable file, place the cursor within a variable and use the copy function to copy the Liquid tag for that variable to the clipboard. For example, with the cursor on a variable called `prodname_docs` the tag `{% data variables.product.prodname_docs %}` is copied into the clipboard.
   - Anywhere in a reusable file, use the copy function and the appropriate Liquid tag is copied to the clipboard. For example, in a reusable file called `user-settings.md`, the copy function puts the tag `{% data reusables.path.to.user-settings %}` into the clipboard.
   - Anywhere in a feature version file, use the copy function to create the `ifversion` tags for that feature version. For example, in a feature version file called `copilot.yml` the tags `{% ifversion copilot %}{% endif %}` are copied into the clipboard.
   
Alternatively run the extension from the command palette by choosing **Open reusable file** or **Copy the reusable at the cursor position**.
